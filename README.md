# Deru
Deru is a **visual editor** for headless CMS's.

Deru is slightly opinionated. It is highly customizable, but it offers templating for common content structures such as blogs or educational and professional content.

Headless CMS's take the weight off the front-end when working with static content, but editing the content can be difficult. Hence we propose a visual editor, for editing complex and customizable (and modular) content.

This is in the early stages of planning and development.
