# Deru
Deru is an embeddable rich content editor for react. The editor is a WYSIWYG system that live updates a JSON object storing the page information.

### Deru Works for Headless CMS's
Headless CMS's take the weight off the front-end when working with static content, but editing the content can be difficult. Hence we propose a visual editor, for editing complex and modular content.

This is in the early stages of planning and development.
